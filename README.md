# Effects-of-Noisy-Electrocardiogram-Signal-on-Heartbeat-Detection-Performance

This repository includes codes for our paper: "An Analysis of the Effects of Noisy Electrocardiogram Signal on Heartbeat Detection Performance" Ziti Fariha Mohd Apandi, Ryojun Ikeura, Soichiro Hayakawa and Shigeyoshi Tsutsumi, which was submitted to the Journal of Bioengineering - MDPI.

The MATLAB scripts and functions were implement on MATLAB R2018b and a 4.00GHz Intel Core i7-7y75 processor. It is suggested to use this version of MATLAB for easier setup.

To run the algorithm, run the mainPanTompkins.m file for PanTompkins algorithm, mainHamilton.m file for Hamilton algorithm and wqrs_algo.m file for WQRS algorithm in Matlab. To run the WQRS algorithm, you need to use MATLAB WFDB Toolbox provided in Physionet website. The WFDB Toolbox provides access from MATLAB to applications in the WFDB Software Package in Physionet website.

If you use any part of this repository for research, please consider to cite our aforementioned work.
